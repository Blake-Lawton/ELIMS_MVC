# ELIMS_MVC README

Hello!

This is our senior computer science capstone project at Northern Arizona University, 2018-2019. We are the LabRats, a capstone team consisting of Remy Brandriff and Julian Bell with team mentor Ana Steinmacher (formerly Jun Rao). Our website is <a href="https://www.cefns.nau.edu/capstone/projects/CS/2019/LabRats-S19/about.html">here</a>. Julian is the team leader, document editor, and communications chief, while Remy is the webmaster and architect; both are coding on the project. In the first semester, with little coding being done during the requirements acquisition phase, we utilized Google Drives for our development. Now that we are actually implementing the system, we have transitioned here to GitHub.

Our project is <a href="https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~edo/Classes/CS_Capstone/Projects/F18/Baxter-EnvLabSys3.pdf">the Environmental Laboratory Informatics and Management System</a>, a web app that will be able to facilitate lab usage requests and lab management for the Environmental Engineering (ENE) Lab at NAU. It will be hosted and maintained by NAU ITS following our graduation in May, 2019. The project is being developed in Visual Studio as an MVC web app.

You can see our documentation from the first semester in the <a href="https://github.com/remyBrandriff/ELIMS_MVC/tree/master/CS476">CS476 folder.</a> Our Visual Studio solution is also maintained here in this repo.
